#What will this talk do for you?

Notes:
So now, you must be wondering, why should I keep sitting here. What is this dude promising?

#This talk will not teach you CS fundamentals
* Computer fundamentals are important, and needed to write working code.
* Most job interviews go over CS fundamentals.
* Get Good at Googling
* Resources to learn: [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/)

Notes:
As much as computer science (CS) students will complain about boring CS fundamentals, they are quite important. Understanding computer science at it's core, is not an easy task, but it will help your code A LOT. Also, most, like 99.9999999%, of developer interviews will be testing not only if you can write code, but if you know the fundamentals, to make it even better. You should have a good understanding of variables, arrays, lists, if/else statements, loops, etc... before trying to embark on a real project. Also, having a good grasp on how to search/google for when your code breaks is essential to being a programmer. Resources like: [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), and [r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/) are great places to start.

#This talk teaches you how to code cool stuff (maybe)
* Knowing JUST CS fundamentals, and the fastest sorting algorithm, wont make that app or game.
* Today, I will walk you through modern web frameworks to make web/mobile apps
* We are going to make a little todo application with a website and a server

Notes:
As in the previous slide, CS fundamentals are important. But, knowing the fastest sorting algorithm by heart wont make that sweet video game, or that anonymous/secure chat application. I am here to try and walk you through some modern day, and popular, frameworks that power web/mobile apps, in both the client (the app you download), and the server (the thing that stores all your information)
