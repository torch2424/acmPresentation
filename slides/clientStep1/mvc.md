# MVC (Model View Controller)

Angular JS is a frontend framework that allows developers to quickly and easily implement MVC.

* M (Model) - The data that is being shared in the client. For AngularJS, this would be $scope, ng-model, and {{scopeVariableName}}.
* V (View) - The actual components and view that the user sees. For AngularJS, this would be the HTML and CSS.
* C (Controller) - The Javascript that runs code on actions performed on the view. For AngularJS, this would be your controller, that the view calls on using things like ng-click, ng-change.

Notes:
Explain Model View Controller, go back to the previous example, and use ng model as the basis to help explain
