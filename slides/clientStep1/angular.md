# What is a "client"?

* A "Client" is the app that you download as a website, or from the app store
* Today, we will be using AngularJS (Not Angular 2) for our client. It's fast, versatile, and has lots of jobs!
* We will be coding in [JsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), so please, create one to follow along! (No account required, i think...)

Notes:
Explain why not angular 2. It is young, and you aren't missing out by learning angular 1 first. You still learn MVC principles and stuff, which then easily transfer over.
